**Date:** October 4, 2025

This review assesses the provided **MERN stack "Book Review Platform"** codebase against the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, version 1.0**.

---

## 🧩 Overall Assessment

The project is well-structured and substantially meets the requirements outlined in the SRS.  
The developer has correctly implemented the **MERN stack**, followed the **MVC pattern** on the backend, and created a **component-based architecture** on the frontend.  
Core features like **user authentication**, **book and review CRUD operations**, and bonus features like **dark mode** and **profile pages** are present and functional.

However, there are some **minor deviations from the SRS**, **areas for improvement in robustness**, and a **theme consistency issue** in the UI.

## 🛠️ Identified Issues and Recommendations

| **Criticality** | **Issue**                            | **Description**                                                                                              | **Recommendation**                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low**         | **Theme Inconsistency in Navbar**    | The `Navbar` component uses a hardcoded `bg-blue-600` color, breaking theme consistency.                     | Use Tailwind’s dark mode variants (e.g., `dark:bg-gray-800`) so it adapts to the selected theme. _(Already fixed in provided file.)_ |
| **Low**         | **Use of `window.confirm()`**        | The `BookDetailsPage.jsx` uses a browser-native dialog for delete confirmation, which disrupts the UI style. | Replace `window.confirm()` with a custom modal component for a consistent user experience.                                           |
| **Trivial**     | **Unused State in `App.jsx`**        | The state `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);` is declared but unused.                                   | Remove the unused state to clean up the code.                                                                                        |
| **Trivial**     | **Missing `key` Prop in Form Loops** | Mapped elements in the add/edit book forms (like year dropdowns) lack unique keys.                           | Add unique `key` props to prevent inefficient re-renders.                                                                            |
